def update_defender_strength(season):
    """
    Calculates and updates player_strength values for defenders in a given season.

    This function evaluates the performance of defenders (center backs and full backs) 
    using a combination of expected goals, passing metrics, and goals added data. 
    It adjusts expected goals to exclude penalty xG, normalizes each key metric 
    across qualified players, and calculates a weighted strength score that reflects 
    both defensive and passing contributions. Results are written to the `player_xgoals` table.

    Args:
        season (int): The season year for which defender strength scores will be calculated.

    Process Overview:
        - Retrieves defender data from xGoals, xPass, and goals added sources.
        - Builds a profile for each defender, excluding those missing key data.
        - Deducts penalty xG to prevent inflation of attacking metrics.
        - Filters out players with insufficient minutes.
        - Normalizes statistics such as passing over expected, xG, and goals added.
        - Computes strength scores using defined weightings for each attribute.
        - Updates the database with strength scores for qualified players.
        - Sets player_strength to 0 for unqualified players.

    Notes:
        The final strength score is scaled between 0 and 100. It emphasizes defensive disruption 
        (interrupting GA), passing quality, and involvement, while still acknowledging limited 
        offensive contributions like xG.
