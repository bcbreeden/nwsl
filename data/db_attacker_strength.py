def update_attacker_strength(season):
    """
    Calculates and updates strength scores for attackers in a given season.

    This function processes goal-scoring and creative metrics for forwards (ST, W),
    excluding penalty goals and xG, then normalizes the metrics and assigns a composite 
    strength score based on weighted contributions. Scores are saved to the database.

    Args:
        season (int): The season year to calculate attacker strength for.

    Process Overview:
        - Fetches xG, goals, and goals added metrics.
        - Filters for attacking positions and deducts penalties.
        - Normalizes key metrics like xG, goals, xA, shots, and goals added.
        - Applies weighted formula to calculate player strength scores.
        - Saves updated scores to the `player_xgoals` table.
        - Sets unqualified players (low minutes) to strength = 0.
