title: 2025 NWSL Week 11 Power Rankings
excerpt: As the season settles into its middle stretch, patterns are starting to emerge, but not every story fits neatly in the standings. Rose Lavelle’s return added a spark to Gotham’s midfield, while teams like Washington and Louisville are showing resilience beneath the surface. These rankings combine form, stats, and something harder to quantify; identity, momentum, and the quiet ways teams shape their futures week by week.

Week 11 of the NWSL season brought story lines everywhere you looked, dramatic comebacks, late-game heartbreaks, and a few upsets that shook up the rankings. As teams look to the second half of the season, form is starting to matter more than potential, and the margins are getting thinner. Some clubs are rising with quiet confidence, others are stumbling just as they begin to find rhythm. From Kansas City’s continued dominance to the gritty flashes from last-place Utah, this week’s power rankings reflect not just results, but the deeper trends pushing each team forward or holding them back.

How It Works
------------

These power rankings are driven by a data model that goes beyond wins and losses to measure true team performance. The model looks at metrics like expected goals (xG), goal difference, xPoints, and finishing efficiency to evaluate how well teams are creating chances, limiting danger, and converting opportunities. It rewards teams that consistently control matches, even if the scoreboard doesn’t always reflect it.

The goal isn’t to reflect standings or recent results, it’s to highlight sustainable performance patterns. A narrow loss with strong underlying numbers may be worth more than a win built on low-percentage moments. The model updates each week using current-season data, and because the NWSL has a balanced schedule (every team plays each other twice), strength of schedule is naturally accounted for. It’s not perfect, but it’s designed to cut through short-term noise and surface which teams are _actually_ playing the best.

1\. Kansas City Current (-)
---------------------------

The rain could not stop the Current as they came out swinging and hit Gotham early with two goals in just over ten minutes.

Michelle Cooper and Temwa Chawinga wasted no time putting Kansas City on the front foot, converting both early chances with clinical precision. The Current were out-possessed 62% to 38% and completed just 270 passes compared to Gotham’s 427, but the story was efficiency. Kansas City registered 5 shots on target from only 8 attempts and led convincingly in xG (1.74 to 0.64), showing once again that their attacking style is not just explosive, it’s effective.

From a season-long view, Kansas City continues to look like the most complete team in the league. They lead the league in goals (24), xGoals (21.4), and xGoal differential (+13.8). Their high verticality (7.2 average vertical distance) and well-above-expected passing (1.0 passes over expected per 100) show they’re not afraid to take risks, and they usually pay off. Add in standout goals added numbers in receiving (7.9), shooting (3.9), and interrupting (5.1), and you get a team that applies pressure in every phase of the game. The top spot remains theirs for now as they prepare to host Racing Saturday night.

2\. Orlando Pride (-)
---------------------

Orlando left it late, but Cori Dyke’s 90+9’ winner secured all three points in a hard-fought 1–0 victory. The Pride dictated the tempo from start to finish, holding 57 percent possession and outshooting Houston 22 to 8. They produced a match xG of 1.25 and put 8 shots on target, consistently pressing forward while maintaining control in midfield. While Houston’s post-shot xG of 1.36 suggested a few dangerous moments, the Pride's backline held its shape and composure when it mattered most.

From a season-long view, Orlando remains one of the league’s most balanced teams. Their xGoal differential of +6.9 and pass over expected differential of +110.9 reflect technical sharpness and tactical patience. They lead the league in total passes over expected (163.7) and maintain an elite 81.2 percent pass completion rate. With strong receiving (7.5 goals added) and shooting metrics (4.2), the Pride continue to show why they are a threat in every phase of play.

The Pride hit the road and head west for a show down against Bay for NWSL After Dark Friday night.

3\. San Diego Wave (-)
----------------------

San Diego sits at number three after losing a heartbreaker upset to the Reign. Despite controlling the game for long stretches, they never held the lead and were punished late by a clinical Seattle side.

The Wave dominated possession with 63 percent, completed 583 passes at an 86 percent clip, and registered 8 shots to Seattle’s 7. Delphine Cascarino’s 75th-minute equalizer gave the home crowd hope, but Seattle responded with a dagger in the 87th to seal the 2–1 result. The xG battle was nearly even at 0.69 to 0.6, but Seattle edged ahead in post-shot xG, 1.18 to 1.02, reflecting the sharpness of their finishing despite limited opportunities.

Zooming out, San Diego remains one of the strongest sides in the league by the numbers. Their goal differential of +7 contrasts with a much lower xGoal differential of -2.5, suggesting they’ve consistently finished above expectation. Their league-leading pass accuracy and 119 passes over expected highlight how well-drilled and technically sound this team is. With elite receiving and interrupting metrics, the Wave control the game better than most teams.

San Diego looks to bounce back against the struggling Dash next.

4\. Portland Thorns (-)
-----------------------

The Thorns... are a weird team. They sit 4-4-3 and have only won two of their last five and yet here they sit in fourth.

Their latest outing, a 1–0 loss to Bay FC, sums it up. Portland controlled the ball with 55 percent possession, outshot Bay 16 to 10, and won 9 corners to 1. But for all their attacking pressure, they couldn’t find the net. Defensively, they limited Bay to just two shots on target, but one of them went in. It’s the kind of result that frustrates fans and stat models alike.

And yet, Portland remains one of the most statistically complete teams in the league. They lead the NWSL in xGoals (20.0) and rank second in xGoal differential at +6.0. Their underlying metrics paint a clear picture: this is a team that should be scoring more than it has. Their passing remains sharp, with 1.7 goals added from build-up play and a +0.8 pass over expected differential. Their shooting (3.8 goals added) and receiving (6.8) stats continue to reinforce their ability to generate and capitalize on chances. The record may look average, but the foundation is anything but.

5\. Washington Spirit (-)
-------------------------

This is one of the rare times that I firmly believe a team is undervalued by the model. Sitting at 7-1-3 and winning three of their last four, with the injuries they have, shows me a team with considerable depth. They have a high ceiling and as they get healthier, they are gaining momentum.

Their 3–1 win over the North Carolina Courage was another example of grit and execution. Despite being outshot 15 to 11 and facing nearly double the xG (2.58 to 1.32), Washington capitalized early and held firm late. Goals from Courtney Brown, Brittany Ratcliffe, and Gift Monday punctuated a clinical attacking performance, even if the underlying stats tilted the other way. While the Courage generated more opportunities, the Spirit were ruthless in transition and efficient with their finishing.

Washington’s season metrics don’t jump off the page, but they tell a story of balance. Their xGoal differential is nearly neutral at -0.3, and their passing numbers are modest, with a slight negative pass over expected differential. But look closer and you’ll find high-value contributions in receiving (7.5 goals added) and interrupting (6.6), signs of a team that thrives in chaotic, end-to-end moments. As they regain health and confidence, Washington looks increasingly like a top-tier threat, no matter what the numbers say.

6\. Racing Louisville (+2)
--------------------------

The first movement of the week is a good one for the Racing faithful. Louisville is up two spots this week after a burner against Utah.

It was far from a perfect defensive performance, but Racing got the job done in a thrilling 3–2 win. Goals from Emma Sears, Ellie Jean, and a late winner from Sarah Weber pushed Louisville over the top after surrendering the lead in the first half. They fired off 20 shots and generated 1.99 xG, with 9 of those efforts landing on target. The post-shot xG of 2.49 shows the sheer quality of chances they produced, and their late pressure ultimately paid off.

Statistically, Louisville’s attack has quietly been one of the most effective in the league. Their xGoal differential sits at +3.3, and they continue to outperform the ball with 1.8 passes over expected per 100 attempts, second only to Orlando. They’ve added 3.5 goals from shooting actions and 5.4 from receiving, underscoring a forward line that’s not just creating, but finishing. There’s room to tighten up defensively, but the attacking upside is real. For now, they’re trending in the right direction.

7\. Angel City FC (-)
---------------------

I gave up trying to figure out ACFC weeks ago and this week was yet another reason why. They almost fumble against Chicago, a game that offered them a beautiful opportunity to get back on the right side of things.

Angel City looked in control early and built a 1–0 lead through Kennedy Fuller, only to concede twice in an eight-minute stretch that flipped the game on its head. Mary Vignola’s 80th-minute equalizer salvaged the draw, but it felt more like a let-off than a point earned. Statistically, they were far superior. They led 15 to 10 in shots, 5 to 4 in shots on target, and posted 1.62 xG compared to Chicago’s 0.58. Their post-shot xG of 2.02 points to genuine attacking quality, not just speculative efforts.

Looking at the season as a whole, Angel City has scored 19 goals on 14.3 expected, a sign of reliable finishing. Their passing goals added is 2.0, and their receiving value ranks among the best at 6.0. They consistently show they can progress the ball with intent and create chances. What remains elusive is the ability to close matches with the same consistency. The tools are there, but the rhythm still isn’t.

They get another opportunity at home as they welcome the Courage this week.

8\. Seattle Reign (+1)
----------------------

Seattle upset the narrative last week by upsetting San Diego on the road. That gives them a well-earned one spot bump coming into week 12.

The Reign struck first through Sally Menti in the 67th minute, only to see their lead erased just eight minutes later. But they didn’t flinch. Emeri Adames delivered the winner in the 87th minute, capping off a disciplined and opportunistic performance. Seattle conceded 63 percent possession and completed just 345 passes, but they made the most of their moments. They tallied four shots on target from seven total and edged out San Diego in post-shot xG, 1.18 to 1.02.

Seattle’s season metrics are still modest on paper. Their xGoal differential remains negative at -2.2, and they’re underperforming in passing with -1.9 passes over expected per 100. But they shine in interrupting play with 5.9 goals added and are becoming increasingly efficient in front of goal, with 2.3 goals added from shooting. It’s not dominance, but it is progress and that’s enough to climb.

9\. Gotham FC (-3)
------------------

Welcome back Rose Lavelle. Unfortunately, it was not the homecoming she wanted as Gotham's free fall continues as they plummet three spots this week.

Gotham fell 2–1 at home to Kansas City in a match where they never found their rhythm. Although they recorded 11 shots, only two were on target, and their expected-goals tally of 0.64 paled against KC’s 1.74. Kansas City struck twice within the first 11 minutes; Gotham’s late consolation came via an own goal, leaving them no time to level the score. Despite enjoying 62 percent possession and completing nearly 160 more passes, several of Gotham’s most dangerous attacks were ruled out. It was a rough outing, but not without a few encouraging flashes.

While it was a frustrating night, there is some good news. Gotham still has a positive xGoal differential at +2.0 and a pass over expected differential of +40.8, showing that they move the ball well and often limit opponents. But their goals for sits at 11 on 12.1 expected, and they’re struggling to convert. Their receiving and shooting metrics are middling, and even their previously stout defense is slipping. Lavelle’s return should help long term, but for now, Gotham needs more than just possession to stop the slide.

10\. Bay FC (-)
---------------

Bay FC remains one of the most puzzling teams in the league, but this week they earned full credit. A 1–0 win over Portland is no small feat, and it comes with their second clean sheet in three games.

The numbers weren’t flashy. Bay had just 45 percent possession and only two shots on target from ten total attempts. They were outshot 16 to 10 and defended nine Portland corners. But Alyssa Malonson’s 39th-minute goal was enough, and the back line held firm under pressure. This was a match about resolve, not rhythm, and Bay managed it well.

From a season-long perspective, Bay continues to outperform their expected metrics. They’ve scored 13 goals on just 10.4 xG and sit at +2.6 in goals over expected. Their xGoal differential is -3.8, yet they’ve managed to stay competitive in matches that the model suggests they shouldn’t. Defensively, they’ve been leaky, but this match might be a turning point. There’s still a lot to prove, but results like this keep them in the conversation.

11\. North Carolina Courage (-)
-------------------------------

Just as the offense finds some momentum, the defense begins to fall off. This weeks loss to Washington was another frustrating reminder of why strength is needed on both sides of the pitch.

Manaka Matsukubo scored again, continuing to be one of the league’s brightest attacking sparks, but the Courage couldn’t hold back the Spirit. Despite posting 15 shots, 8 on target, and a dominant 2.58 xG, they came away with just one goal. On the other end, they conceded three times on 1.32 xG. It was a game where North Carolina created more and arguably deserved better, but defensive lapses and finishing inefficiency cost them.

Over the season, the Courage have built a curious profile. They’ve scored 13 goals on 15.3 expected and actually hold a positive xGoal differential of +0.8. Their passing numbers remain strong with 77.1 percent completion and a solid +30.8 pass over expected differential. But they’ve allowed 18 goals on just 14.5 expected, a sign that their defensive issues go beyond positioning and enter the realm of individual breakdowns. The foundation is there, and the offense is finally coming alive, but until the defense sharpens, this team will stay stuck in the middle.

The defense gets no rest this week as they head west to face Alyssa Thompson and company.

12\. Houston Dash (-)
---------------------

Houston has heart, I will give them that. Unfortunately, it was not enough to hold off the late game heroics of Orlando.

The Dash defended for most of the match and nearly escaped with a point, but Cori Dyke’s 90+9’ goal sealed a crushing 1–0 loss. Houston allowed 22 shots and 8 on target while generating only 8 shots themselves. Possession was tilted against them at 57 to 43 percent, and they were outpassed 499 to 403. It wasn’t a collapse, but it was a slow bleed that finally caught up to them.

Across the season, Houston continues to underperform relative to their metrics. Their xGoal differential is -2.6, but their actual goal differential is -8, showing a lack of finishing and defensive sharpness in key moments. They’ve scored 9 goals on 10.0 expected and allowed 17 on just 12.6 expected. Even when the shape holds, the breakdowns hurt. With negative values in passing and dribbling goals added, the Dash are struggling to create or disrupt with consistency. The effort is always there. The results are not.

13\. Chicago Stars (-)
----------------------

The Chicago Stars are a team that I root for every week. I am not sure what it is about them, but there’s something quietly beautiful about this team. They are flawed, yes, and the numbers rarely favor them. But each week, they lace up and step into the fire with defiance. Against Angel City, they clawed their way back from a goal down with strikes from Nádia Gomes and Ally Schlegel in the span of eight minutes. For a moment, it felt like it might be theirs. The equalizer from Angel City late on stung, but it didn’t erase the grit, the urgency, or the hope.

Chicago finished the match with just 38 percent possession and completed 280 passes to LA’s 441, but they made their moments count. Their xG was only 0.58, yet they buried two chances and held a high-flying Angel City side to a draw. The Stars still have a league-worst -13 goal differential and a -7.9 xGoal differential. But they fight for every inch. Their interrupting and receiving stats show signs of structure, and their recent matches hint at something more cohesive. It’s not all there yet, but it’s starting to feel like it could be.

14\. Utah Royals (-)
--------------------

Speaking of punching above your weight class, the Royals were less than five regulation minutes away from stealing a point from Racing! Unfortunately, they stay in the basement via an 85th minute dagger from Sarah Weber.

Utah got off to a dream start with a third-minute goal from Brecken Mozingo and a first-half equalizer from Bianca St-Georges, but their defensive shape began to unravel late. Despite holding 56 percent possession and generating 17 shots with 8 on target, they couldn’t close the door. Statistically, it was one of their stronger performances, and the match was far more balanced than the standings suggest.

But the numbers don’t lie over time. The Royals now sit with a -12 goal differential and a -12.9 xGoal differential, the worst in the league by both measures. They’ve shown flashes and the attack occasionally sparks to life, but structural cracks remain. Whether it’s fatigue, lapses in concentration, or lack of depth, the margins are thin and often unforgiving. This team keeps swinging, but for now, they remain stuck at the bottom.

With every passing week, the league feels more unpredictable and more competitive. Stars are returning, underdogs are refusing to fold, and every club is being tested in different ways. The table may not lie, but the power rankings tell a deeper story. We’ll be watching to see who rises, who regroups, and who refuses to go quietly.

Until next time.
