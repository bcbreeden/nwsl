title: I want to talk about Denise O'Sullivan
excerpt: Denise Oâ€™Sullivan is not flashy, but she is everywhere. She leads all midfielders in touches, pass efficiency, and defensive interruptions. She does not need the spotlight to dominate a game, she just does the work that holds it all together. If the Courage have an identity, it starts with her.

If you only look at goals and assists, you might not notice her. If you only check highlight reels, you might miss her. But if you actually watch the North Carolina Courage play, if you pay attention to what keeps their machine running, then you know.

Denise O'Sullivan is everywhere.

No player in the NWSL better embodies the phrase "doing the work behind the scenes." And no one is more essential to the Courage's identity.

### She plays more than anyone and touches everything.

Through nine matches, O'Sullivan has logged over 900 minutes, among the highest in the league. She leads all midfielders in share of team touches at nearly 11 percent, meaning more than one in every ten Courage touches goes through her. That is tempo-setting. That is control.

She has attempted 463 passes, most among midfielders, and completed them at an elite 84.5 percent clip, nearly 3.4 percent above expectation. She leads the entire position in passes completed above expected. This is not just volume. This is difficulty-adjusted accuracy under pressure.

In short, she is the steady heartbeat that enables success.

### She is quietly elite in the build up.

O'Sullivan leads all midfielders in interrupting actions and interrupting goals added. Her 174 total interrupting actions are more than double the positional average. And her interrupting goals added above average ranks near the very top of her position. She does not just pressure. She regains.

You do not always see the moment she wins a ball back or closes off a passing lane. But you feel the shift in possession. You feel the Courage breathe again. And more often than not, it is O'Sullivan who made that happen.

### She contributes without chasing credit.

Despite playing one of the deepest roles in the league, she still ranks above average in key passes, expected assists, and pass impact metrics. Her 9 key passes and 0.7 expected assists are quiet testaments to her ability to push play forward when the moment demands it.

She does not need the spotlight. She moves play from chaos to structure, from structure to threat. Her job is not to be seen. Her job is to hold it all together. And she does that better than almost anyone.

### This is not new. It is who she has always been.

Since arriving at North Carolina in 2017, O'Sullivan has been the team's tactical spine. She has been voted MVP by her teammates multiple times, named to NWSL Best XI and Second XI squads, captained the Courage, and played an essential role in both of the club's championship runs.

She is a two-time NWSL Champion, a Challenge Cup winner, and a national team mainstay for Ireland with over a hundred caps to her name. And she is still evolving. Still improving. Still doing the work that makes others shine brighter.

### To conclude...

Denise O'Sullivan is not a stat-sheet superstar. She is the foundation beneath it. The Courage may bring in new stars, shift tactics, or change formations, but as long as O'Sullivan is on the pitch, they have an identity.

She is consistency. She is control. She is the definition of indispensable.

Until next time.
