# NWSL Week 11 Power Rankings

Week 11 of the NWSL season brought story lines everywhere you looked, dramatic comebacks, late-game heartbreaks, and a few upsets that shook up the rankings. As teams look to the second half of the season, form is starting to matter more than potential, and the margins are getting thinner. Some clubs are rising with quiet confidence, others are stumbling just as they begin to find rhythm. From Kansas City’s continued dominance to the gritty flashes from last-place Utah, this week’s power rankings reflect not just results, but the deeper trends pushing each team forward or holding them back.

## How It Works

These power rankings are driven by a data model that goes beyond wins and losses to measure true team performance. The model looks at metrics like expected goals (xG), goal difference, xPoints, and finishing efficiency to evaluate how well teams are creating chances, limiting danger, and converting opportunities. It rewards teams that consistently control matches, even if the scoreboard doesn’t always reflect it.

The goal isn’t to reflect standings or recent results, it’s to highlight sustainable performance patterns. A narrow loss with strong underlying numbers may be worth more than a win built on low-percentage moments. The model updates each week using current-season data, and because the NWSL has a balanced schedule (every team plays each other twice), strength of schedule is naturally accounted for. It’s not perfect, but it’s designed to cut through short-term noise and surface which teams are actually playing the best.

## 1. Kansas City Current (-)

The rain could not stop the Current as they came out swinging and hit Gotham early with two goals in just over ten minutes.

Michelle Cooper and Temwa Chawinga wasted no time putting Kansas City on the front foot, converting both early chances with clinical precision. The Current were out-possessed 62% to 38% and completed just 270 passes compared to Gotham’s 427, but the story was efficiency. Kansas City registered 5 shots on target from only 8 attempts and led convincingly in xG (1.74 to 0.64), showing once again that their attacking style is not just explosive, it’s effective.

From a season-long view, Kansas City continues to look like the most complete team in the league. They lead the league in goals (24), xGoals (21.4), and xGoal differential (+13.8). Their high verticality (7.2 average vertical distance) and well-above-expected passing (1.0 passes over expected per 100) show they’re not afraid to take risks, and they usually pay off. Add in standout goals added numbers in receiving (7.9), shooting (3.9), and interrupting (5.1), and you get a team that applies pressure in every phase of the game. The top spot remains theirs for now as they prepare to host Racing Saturday night.

## 2. Orlando Pride (-)

Orlando left it late, but Cori Dyke’s 90+9’ winner secured all three points in a hard-fought 1–0 victory. The Pride dictated the tempo from start to finish, holding 57 percent possession and outshooting Houston 22 to 8. They produced a match xG of 1.25 and put 8 shots on target, consistently pressing forward while maintaining control in midfield. While Houston’s post-shot xG of 1.36 suggested a few dangerous moments, the Pride’s backline held its shape and composure when it mattered most.

From a season-long view, Orlando remains one of the league’s most balanced teams. Their xGoal differential of +6.9 and pass over expected differential of +110.9 reflect technical sharpness and tactical patience. They lead the league in total passes over expected (163.7) and maintain an elite 81.2 percent pass completion rate. With strong receiving (7.5 goals added) and shooting metrics (4.2), the Pride continue to show why they are a threat in every phase of play.

The Pride hit the road and head west for a show down against Bay for NWSL After Dark Friday night.

## 3. San Diego Wave (-)

San Diego sits at number three after losing a heartbreaker upset to the Reign. Despite controlling the game for long stretches, they never held the lead and were punished late by a clinical Seattle side.

The Wave dominated possession with 63 percent, completed 583 passes at an 86 percent clip, and registered 8 shots to Seattle’s 7. Delphine Cascarino’s 75th-minute equalizer gave the home crowd hope, but Seattle responded with a dagger in the 87th to seal the 2–1 result. The xG battle was nearly even at 0.69 to 0.6, but Seattle edged ahead in post-shot xG, 1.18 to 1.02, reflecting the sharpness of their finishing despite limited opportunities.

Zooming out, San Diego remains one of the strongest sides in the league by the numbers. Their goal differential of +7 contrasts with a much lower xGoal differential of -2.5, suggesting they’ve consistently finished above expectation. Their league-leading pass accuracy and 119 passes over expected highlight how well-drilled and technically sound this team is. With elite receiving and interrupting metrics, the Wave control the game better than most teams.
