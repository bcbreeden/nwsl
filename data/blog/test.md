# My First Blog Post

Welcome to the blog! Here’s where I write about soccer stats.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover topics like:

- xG and advanced metrics  
- Player and team analysis  
- Match simulations and model-building  
- NC Courage content (because I’m biased)

Stay tuned for new entries every week. Let’s dive deep into the data that makes the game beautiful.

*Thanks for reading!*
