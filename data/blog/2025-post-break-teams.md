The NWSL is a unique league in that the talent is fairly even in its distribution, so that any one team could beat any other. Looking at the top of the table, there is little doubt who the favorites are: Kansas City, Orlando, and San Diego lead the way. The interesting shuffle is going to happen in the middle, and that is where we are going to look. What teams are knocking on the door? Will a team sneak into the playoff hunt at the last minute? Is there a champion in the chaotic center? Or is there a last charge for those at the bottom as they scramble to make the postseason?

Here are a few teams I will be keeping an eye on in August.

### Gotham FC
As of this writing, Gotham is ranked eighth and is on the bubble. But make no mistake, Gotham is a strong team, and they are getting a key piece of their attack back from the injury list: Rose Lavelle. During her limited minutes prior to the break and in the friendlies that followed, Rose has looked fantastic. It will be exciting to see her pair up with the current Golden Boot leader, Esther.

On top of an offensive weapon returning to form, we cannot move on until we talk about Ann-Katrin Berger. If you are reading this, there is little doubt that you have seen the heroics she put on display in the UEFA quarterfinal against France. The 34-year-old veteran continues to show resolve and poise in the biggest moments. She will look to continue that trend when she returns to the NWSL to face off against the Chicago Stars.

### North Carolina Courage
It is easy to sleep on the Courage. However, they have won two in a row going into the break, and their offensive pressure has greatly improved. The question for this team is a simple one: can they pick up where they left off? That is the real question when we talk about the Courage. It is hard to have confidence because there have been times they seem lost. On the other hand, we have seen flashes of brilliance and an offensive engine that has the potential to win games.

We will not have to wait long to find out. In August, they get their rematch against the red-hot San Diego Wave at home.

### Racing Louisville
Racing went twelve rounds with the Orlando Pride and came out on top to close out before the international break, a statement win that has me wondering if they can pull it together. Taylor Flint will need to continue to inspire her teammates as she looks to keep putting together an incredible campaign, leading all defensive midfielders with 3 goals, 24 shots, and 6 shots on target.

Here is the rub. Racing has, without a doubt, the most challenging schedule coming out of the break: KC Current at home, then Orlando, Washington, and San Diego on the road. They will need to dig deep and find something, but I am rooting for them.

### Angel City FC
I want to believe. I really do. Alyssa Thompson and Riley Tiernan have been a delight to watch. Few can question their offensive potential, as they rank third in the NWSL standings for goals scored (as of this writing).

But let's address the elephant in the room: their defense has to be better. They have conceded 22 goals from 19.3 expected goals against, highlighting that their defensive lapses are occurring on lower-quality chances. If Tiernan and company can get some support on the defensive side of the ball, ACFC can make a run at it.

As we head into the final stretch of the regular season, the stage is set for chaos, comebacks, and potential Cinderella stories. The top contenders may have established their foothold, but the real drama will unfold in the crowded middle, where one win can launch a team into playoff position and one slip can spell disaster. With international players returning, injuries healing, and momentum swinging wildly from match to match, August promises to be a defining month. Whether it is a powerhouse reclaiming form or an underdog finding its spark, every match matters now. Buckle up. The playoff race is about to ignite.

Until next time.
