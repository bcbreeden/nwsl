title: I want to talk about Sam Coffey
excerpt: The heartbeat of Portlandâ€™s midfield does not need a spotlight to shine. Sam Coffey anchors the Thorns with poise, precision, and a quiet confidence that sets the rhythm for everything around her. She leads all defensive midfielders in expected assists and ranks near the top in pass completion, key passes, and touches. She is the connector, the stabilizer, the one making sure the chaos never overwhelms the plan. You might not always see her on the highlight reel. But when Portland clicks, Coffey is at the center of it.

There is a steadiness to Sam Coffey that sets her apart. A composure on the ball. A clarity in decision making. A quiet command of the midfield. She is not chasing moments. She is building a foundation, one pass at a time.

And so far in 2025, she is putting together one of the most complete seasons of her career.

### She is the heartbeat of Portland's midfield.

Coffey has attempted nearly 400 passes this season, the most of any player at her position. Her 79.75 percent completion rate is not just high volume, it is high value. She is exceeding her expected pass completion rate by over two percent, and she leads all central midfielders in passes completed over expected.

She ranks second among all midfielders in total touches and is responsible for more than 10 percent of Portland's touches across the pitch. Every build-up starts with her. Every reset flows through her. She is the rhythm.

### She is elevating the attack from the back.

While most defensive midfielders sit behind the play, Coffey is not afraid to pick her spots and press forward. She leads her position in key passes and has already tallied two assists this season. Her expected assist total of 1.14 is the best among defensive midfielders and points to her vision and timing.

Her xG and xA per 90 is nearly triple the positional average. When she pushes forward, it is purposeful. And the payoff is clear.

### She is elite in the little details that matter.

Coffey is adding goals through passing value and interruption, leading her position in both categories. Her passing goals added and passing goals added above average both top the charts. She is also among the leaders in interrupting actions and successful fouling metrics, showing a tactical awareness without needing to dominate physically.

She is consistently doing the little things, the press triggers, the cover runs, the defensive positioning, that let Portland's attackers thrive. It is not loud. But it is essential.

### She is trusted with the captain's armband.

In 2025, Sam Coffey was named captain of the Portland Thorns. That is not a ceremonial title. It is a reflection of how she carries herself on and off the pitch. She is dependable. Grounded. Respected.

She was nominated for Rookie of the Year in 2022. She was named to the Best XI. She helped Portland win the NWSL Championship that same year. Since then, her game has only grown sharper.

In 2024, she helped the United States win Olympic gold, starting in the final. She scored her first two international goals against China and has quietly cemented herself as one of the most consistent midfielders in the national team pool.

### To conclude...

Sam Coffey does not beg for attention. She does not flash or flex. She reads the game, adjusts, and executes. Her value is in her reliability. Her intelligence. Her ability to make the players around her better.

She is not loud. She is not flashy.

She is just consistently brilliant.

Until next time.
