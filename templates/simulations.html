        <p class="text-weight-500">
        Welcome to the NWSL Match Simulator, a tool that lets you simulate head-to-head outcomes between any two NWSL teams using real player, team, and match-level data. Whether you're a fan, analyst, or developer, this tool allows you to explore likely results based on performance trends, not guesswork.
        </p>

        <p class="text-weight-500">
        This simulator is built on shot-based modeling: it samples actual shot events from each team, adjusts for the strength of the opposing goalkeeper, and scales shot volume based on expected goals against (xGA). This means stronger defenses limit chances, while weaker ones open the floodgates, just like in real matches.
        </p>

        <p class="text-weight-500">
        It also factors in post-shot expected goals (PSxG) and team shooting tendencies to produce a more accurate view of how a match might unfold. By running the simulation hundreds of times, you get a clearer picture of outcome probabilities, goal distributions, and even likely scorers.

                <p class="no-padding-no-margin text-weight-500"><strong>Include Penalties:</strong> Choose whether to include penalty kicks in team shooting data.</p>
                <p class="no-padding-no-margin text-weight-500">
                    <strong>Use PSxG:</strong> Enable post-shot expected goals, which captures shot quality based on placement and trajectory. By default, xGoals are used, which measure the danger of a shot based on factors like distance and angle, but not what the shooter actually did with the ball. PSxG adds that final layer of realism.
